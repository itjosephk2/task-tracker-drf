 ## Features
 
 This backend is designed for individual users or small teams to manage their personal or shared task lists. It is suitable for applications where each user needs secure authentication and private task management via a simple API interface.
 
 - User Registration
 - Token-based Authentication (Login)
 - CRUD functionality for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
 - Authorization: Users can only view and manage their own tasks
 - Deployed to Heroku
 
 ---
 
 ## Technologies Used
 
 - Python 3.13
 - Django 5.1.7

 ## API Endpoints
 
 | Method | Endpoint            | Description              |
 |--------|---------------------|--------------------------|
 | POST   | /api/register/      | Register a new user      |
 | POST   | /api/login/         | Login & get auth token   |
 | GET    | /api/tasks/         | List user's tasks        |
 | POST   | /api/tasks/         | Create new task          |
 | GET    | /api/tasks/<id>/    | Retrieve task by ID      |
 | PUT    | /api/tasks/<id>/    | Fully update task        |
 | PATCH  | /api/tasks/<id>/    | Partially update task    |
 | DELETE | /api/tasks/<id>/    | Delete a task            |
 
 ---
 
 ## Authentication
 
 Authentication is handled using **token-based authentication** from Django REST Framework.
 
 ### Login
 - Endpoint: POST /api/login/
 - Request Body:
 
 
json
 {
   "username": "your_username",
   "password": "your_password"
 }

 
 - Response:
 
json
 {
   "token": "your_token_here"
 }

 
 Use this token in the Authorization header for all protected endpoints:
 
 
Authorization: Token your_token_here

 
 ---
 
 ## Testing

### Automated Testing

Automated tests were implemented using Djangoâ€™s built-in `TestCase` framework to validate key functionality across authentication, task management, and permission enforcement.

#### Test Coverage

**1. User Authentication**

* Token-based login with valid credentials
* Registration with unique username/email
* Rejection of duplicate usernames or invalid data
* Token is returned on successful login
* Invalid login credentials return appropriate error

**2. Task API - CRUD Operations**

| Method   | Endpoint           | Description                                        |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/api/tasks/`      | Create new task                                    |
| `GET`    | `/api/tasks/`      | List all tasks belonging to the authenticated user |
| `GET`    | `/api/tasks/<id>/` | Retrieve a single task by ID                       |
| `PUT`    | `/api/tasks/<id>/` | Fully update a task                                |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/tasks/<id>/` | Partially update a task                            |
| `DELETE` | `/api/tasks/<id>/` | Delete a task                                      |

Each endpoint is tested for:

* Correct HTTP status codes (`201`, `200`, `204`, `403`, `404`)
* Data integrity (e.g. tasks belong only to the authenticated user)
* Validation errors (e.g. missing fields)

**3. Permissions**

* API access is restricted to authenticated users (Token required)
* Users can only access, update, or delete **their own tasks**
* Unauthorized access returns appropriate status codes (`401`, `403`)

#### Test File Location

All test cases are located in:

```plaintext
tasks/tests.py
```

#### Running Tests Locally

To run the test suite and see results in your terminal:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

For coverage reports (optional):

```bash
python run manage.py test
```

---

### Manual Testing

Manual testing was performed using [ReqBin](https://reqbin.com/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to simulate API interaction from the frontend or external clients.

#### Example Requests

> The following examples use placeholder values such as `testuser`, `test@example.com`, and `abc123`. These values must be replaced with valid credentials obtained from your actual registration and login processes.

** Registration**

```http
POST /api/register/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

**Note:** If you attempt to login or access endpoints without having registered a user, you will receive a `400 Bad Request` or `401 Unauthorized` error.

---

** Login**

```http
POST /api/login/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "token": "abc123"
}
```

**Note:** If incorrect login credentials are used, the system will return a `400 Bad Request` with a message like "Invalid credentials."

---

** Create Task**

```http
POST /api/tasks/
Authorization: Token abc123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "New Task",
  "description": "Do something important",
  "due_date": "2025-03-30"
}
```

**Note:** Omitting the token or using an invalid one will result in `401 Unauthorized`.

---

** List Tasks**

```http
GET /api/tasks/
Authorization: Token abc123
```

---

** Update Task**

```http
PATCH /api/tasks/1/
Authorization: Token abc123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "completed": true
}
```

---

** Delete Task**

```http
DELETE /api/tasks/1/
Authorization: Token abc123
```

---

###  Summary of Manual Testing Outcomes

* All endpoints tested with both valid and invalid data
* Authentication flow works correctly from registration to token use
* Unauthorized access and data validation produce correct error codes
* API responses were validated for consistency with expected behavior

# Deployment To Heroku

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). The deployment process is as follows:

Firstly we need to create a new repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/) where our project files will be located

- Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Create a new repository with no template

![Deployment 1](assets/images/readme/create-github-repository.png)

Once you've created your new empty repository, we need to pull this repository down onto our local machine. Throughout the course I have used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create and manage my projects instead of GitPod so I will be demonstrating the process with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- Copy either the HTTPS or SSH URL that has just been generated by [GitHub](https://github.com/)

![Deployment 4](assets/images/readme/git-clone.png)

## Cloning and Opening the Task Tracker DRF Repository

Now we need to open up a command prompt to pull this empty repository down onto our machine

- Open a CMD
- CD to a location you wish to store this project
- Now type **git clone https://github.com/MikeR94/drf-api-deployment-process.git**
- After the project has been pulled down onto your local machine, CD to the project and type **code .** to open the project with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

```bash
# Navigate to the Desktop
cd Desktop

# Clone the GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/itjosephk2/task-tracker-drf.git

# Change into the cloned directory
cd task-tracker-drf

# Open the project in VS Code
code .
``` 

Now it's time to install Django and some additional packages

- Install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
- Create our new project by typing **django-admin startproject drf_api_deployment_process .**


Now we need to add our newly installed apps to our **settings.py** file

![Deployment 4](assets/images/readme/installed-apps.png)

Next, create a new **env.py** file and paste in the following code.
Back in our **settings.py** file we need to import our **env.py** file if it exists

```Python
import os

SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("DJANGO_SECRET_KEY", "fallback-secret-key")
DEBUG = os.getenv("DEBUG", "False") == "True"

# ALLOWED HOSTS (split comma-separated string into a list)
ALLOWED_HOSTS = os.getenv("ALLOWED_HOSTS", "127.0.0.1").split(",")

if os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"):
    DATABASES['default'] = dj_database_url.config(conn_max_age=600)
```

Now it's time to start creating our applications. For my project I created 1 applications

- **tasks**

Don't forget to add these applications to the INSTALLED_APPS variable in **settings.py**

After you have finished developing your application, you are ready to move onto the next deployment steps

First let's install JSON Web Token Authentication

- In the terminal type **pip install dj-rest-auth**

Add both rest frameworkâ€™s auth token and django rest auth to INSTALLED APPS -

```Python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    # rest
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'corsheaders',
    # custom apps
    'tasks',
]
```

Now add the urls to the urlpatterns list **path('dj-rest-auth/', include('dj_rest_auth.urls'))**

```Python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('tasks.urls')),
    path('api/login/', obtain_auth_token, name='api_token_auth'),
]
```

Now migrate the database by typing **python manage.py migrate**

Next install Django All Auth with the following command - **pip install 'dj-rest-auth[with_social]'** and add the new application to the INSTALLED_APPS vairable in **settings.py**

```Python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.sites",
    "allauth",
    "allauth.account",
    "allauth.socialaccount",
    "dj_rest_auth.registration",
]
```

Now add a SITE_ID variable in **settings.py**

```Python
SITE_ID = 1
```

Add the registration urls to the urlpatterns list

```Python
urlpatterns = [
    path('dj-rest-auth/registration/', include('dj_rest_auth.registration.urls')),
]
```

Now it's time to Add JWT tokens functionality, in the terminal type in the following command **pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt**

In **env.py** add the following variable

```Python
os.environ['DEV'] = '1'
```

In **settings.py** set the DEBUG value equal to the DEV variable you just set in **env.py**

```Python
DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ
```

Next, still in **settings.py** add the following code differentiate between development and production modes and also set the pagination and date time format

```Python
REST_PAGINATION = "rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination"

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [
        (
            "rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication"
            if "DEV" in os.environ
            else "dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication"
        )
    ],
    "DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS": REST_PAGINATION,
    "PAGE_SIZE": 100,
    "DATETIME_FORMAT": "%d %b %Y",
}
```

And now add the following code to **settings.py** to enable token authentication, cookie declaration and to also ensure that the tokens are sent over HTTPS only

```Python
REST_USE_JWT = True
JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = "my-app-auth"
JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = "my-refresh-token"
JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = "None"
```

Now we can create a new root route which will act as a welcome screen to anyone who visits the root route of our API

- Create a new **views.py** file in your main project folder (drf_api_league_hub) and add the following code

```Python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response


@api_view()
def root_route(request):
    """
    Function to return a welcome message
    upon loading the API
    """
    return Response({"message": "Welcome to the League Hub DRF API!"})
```

Add that new route to the urlpatterns list in the main **urls.py** file

```Python
from .views import root_route

    path("", root_route),
```

```Python
os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL", "YOUR DB URL HERE",
)
```

In the terminal, type in **pip install dj_database_url**

After that has installed, we need to import it into our main **settings.py** file

```Python
import dj_database_url
```

Now we can seperate the development and production environment databases with the following code

```Python
if "DEV" in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {"default": dj_database_url.parse(
        os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}
    print("Connected to live database")
```

Next we need to install gunicorn. In the terminal, type in the following

- **pip install gunicorn**

Before creating the `Procfile`, make sure you're in the **root directory** of your Django project.

If youâ€™re not already there, use:

```bash
cd task-tracker-drf
```

To let Heroku know how to run your project, create a file named `Procfile` in your projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
touch Procfile
```

Important:

The file must be named exactly Procfile â€” capital "P", no file extension (not .txt, .md, or lowercase).

Heroku is case-sensitive and wonâ€™t recognize it otherwise.

Within that newly created Procfile, add the following code to let Heroku know how to run the project

```Python
release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn drf_api_league_hub.wsgi
```

Back in **settings.py**, we need to tell the project which hosts to allow

```Python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    os.environ.get("ALLOWED_HOST"),
    "127.0.0.1",
]
```

Add it to the MIDDLEWARE list - it is important that it is placed at the top of the list

```Python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
]
```

Now we need to set the ALLOWED_ORIGINS for the network requests made to the server. In **settings.py** file, add the below

```Python
if "CLIENT_ORIGIN" in os.environ:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        os.environ.get("CLIENT_ORIGIN"),
    ]
if "CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV" in os.environ:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS.append(os.environ.get("CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV"))

CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True

JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'
```

Now we need to replace the SECRET_KEY variable in **settings.py** to reference the secret key that we will create in **env.py**

In **env.py** create a new variable called SECRET_KEY and give it a value

```Python
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR SECRET KEY HERE")
```

Now back in **settings.py**, change the SECRET_KEY value to point to the SECRET_KEY you just created in **env.py**

```Python
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
```

Update the requirements file by typing in the command in the terminal **pip freeze > requirements.txt**

- git add
- git commit -m "{message here}
- git push

Now it's time to deploy our new project live for everyone to see on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

- Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
- Click **New app**
- Fill in the relevant information
- Click **Create app** once you are happy

![Deployment 7](assets/images/readme/deployment-7.png)

Once you've created your new [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) application, we need to add some config variables. Click the **settings** tab and then click **Reveal Config Vars**

Make sure to add the following config variables

- ALLOWED_HOST - This is the URL of your deployed project (without the https)
- CLIENT_ORIGIN - This is the URL of your deployed front-end project
- CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV - This is the URL when developing locally
- CLOUDINARY_URL - This is your Cloudinary API key
- DATABASE_URL - This is your production database URL
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC - This will be removed before submission
- SECRET_KEY - This is the secret key you have created

![Deployment 8](assets/images/readme/deployment-8.png)

Now we need to link our [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) application with our [GitHub](https://github.com/) project

- Click the **Deploy** tab
- Choose **GitHub**
- Search for your repository
- Once found, click **Connect**

![Deployment 9](assets/images/readme/deployment-9.png)

Finally, we can deploy our connected projected for everyone to see.

You can either choose **Enable Automatic Deploys** or **Deploy Branch**. I chose to deploy my application manually when I was ready instead of automatic deployments

- Click **Deploy Branch** and wait for it to build
